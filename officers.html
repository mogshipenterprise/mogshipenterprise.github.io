                    <p>When most adventurers picture a moogle, they think of small, fluffy creatures bouncing through the air with their signature pom-poms, delivering letters and getting into mischief. But in this Free Company, Mogumi shatters all expectations—because this moogle isn’t just a leader, he’s an absolute unit.

                      Towering over his kin with an awe-inspiring physique, Mogumi is a big, muscled moogle who commands respect, whether it’s on the battlefield or at the FC’s grand feasts. But make no mistake—behind those rippling biceps and mighty wings lies the heart of a true leader, guiding the Free Company with wisdom, strength, and an occasional flex for emphasis.</p>
